    Unlike other bicycling events,
    <u>randonneuring routes are not marked with painted or posted
    arrows or other signage beyond pre-existing road and traffic signs.</u>
    Instead, the route is defined by a map accompanied by distances, turns, and detailed cue
    notes. This information comprises the official directions for the route. We have
    done our best to embed these notes and directions with an accurate GPS map. This map, combined with a
    GPS navigation unit or compatible Smart Phone device, may prove useful as a navigation assist.
    It&#39;s important that the cue notes are displayed in plain view of the rider so they may be referred to
    frequenly. <em>Items such as Control locations, Hazard Warnings and other useful information are displayed on the
    cue notes only! </em>Cue notes rendered on cue sheets may be abbreviated with common shorthand given in a
    glossary at the top of the cue sheet (eg TFL=Traffic Light, etc...) Please respect that spotting cues, notes,
    and warnings were placed there based on the experience of past riders. Ignore their notes at your
    peril.&nbsp; Keep alert for other route changes and hazards that are not documented.
